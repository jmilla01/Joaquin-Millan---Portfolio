# Joaquin Millan Lanhozo

I have worked in various industries from oil and gas to mass market consumer goods, from different perspectives and with varying degrees of data analysis, but always ideating in my roles using insights I uncover from analyzing the data in front of me. These observations led me to make decisions that helped me improve workflows, improve sales tactics, and overall demonstrate growth visually.

As a data scientist, I consider myself a person who is passionate about data and the power to discover patterns to uncover insights that drive better business decisions.

## Relevant work experience

#### Data Science in Coder House

In this project I developed a clasification model that predicted if a client would suscribe or not to a term deposit.

#### Data Analytics in Rocking data

I  developed a dashboard specifically for my work at Raizen to analyze the company's information about what we sell to our distributors and what our distributors sell to salespoints.

This all started when my company's BI area report was malfunctioning due to unproperly integration of data. I developed this dashboard to solve that problem. I got the sell in information from our company's internal data repository, and for sell out, I used an external repository host for information where it was performed some ETL of data so we could match distributors information to talk the same language as us(for example: transformation of distributors SKUs codes to my companies name and information associated to them).

#### Data Science in Digital House
The objective of this notebook is to see the movement of the Argentinian's government bikes "Ecobicis". We created a model to predict the flow of bikes, this way we could isolate which bike stations have bigger demand and redistribute supply accordingly.

#### Business Intelligence Analyst - Pernod Ricard

As a BI Analyst I was in charge of teaching our sales and marketing departments to use our developed Power BI dashboards to help them make informed decisions.

https://github.com/jmilla01/Joaquin-Millan---Portfolio/blob/main/Induccion_Power_BI.pdf

This dashboard was developed for the BI-EXPORT team, before they didn't had any dashboards, so all their analyses were made in Excel. This dashboard was developed for them so they could manage better their information and using the power of such a good analytical tool such as Power BI. 

This was a project made with a team that involved persons from the relevant areas, the export manager, and IT data engineer, me as a product manager and development of dashboard visualizations. We' ve developed and unite information from diferent sources, made some useful changes to the information that was uploaded on the system, made the connection to Power BI and then created and updated visualizations based on what the export team wanted to see and analyze.

This dashboard was also created as a new analysis tool for the new team that was divided and created to analyse B2B sales performance. Due to confidentiality and not access to the database i will post a PDF showing some visualizations of the pages developed for them

This dashboard has some changes due to confidential information, it was presented as an idea, to show to my bosses, how to analyze our distributors sells to their customers. This then turned into a project of analysing our distributors information, all in one dashboard, where we performed with a bigger team ETL to adapt our distributors information to our companies same language, and then created a big datawarehouse where we had joined all information to be analyzed. (I don't have this final dashboard due to not working more in the company and confidentiality information) but i will post the idea presented at the beginning.
