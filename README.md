# Joaquin Millan Lanhozo

I have worked in various industries from oil and gas to mass market consumer goods, from different perspectives and with varying degrees of data analysis, but always ideating in my roles using insights I uncover from analyzing the data in front of me. These observations led me to make decisions that helped me improve workflows, improve sales tactics, and overall demonstrate growth visually.

As a data scientist, I consider myself a person who is passionate about data and the power to discover patterns to uncover insights that drive better business decisions.

# Works done regarding Data Analysis/ Data Science through courses and work staff.
I'm going to post relevant works done in courses and in work, to track my progress and diferrent appliances of my data skills.

#### Data Science in Coder House

This project has been created during my Data Science classes in Coderhouse, where i developed a clasification model that predicted if a client would suscribe or not to a term deposit.

#### Data Analytics in Rocking data

I made this course, while working in Raizen, so i developed a dashboard used to analyze companies information about Sell in (what we sell to our distributors) and Sell out (what our distributors sell to salespoints), this dashboard might have some changes due to confidential reasons. 

In this project, we got for sell in information our company internal data repository and for sell out an external repository host of information. Regarding sell out information we performed some ETL of data so we could match distributors information to talk the same language between them and with our nomenclature (for example: transformation of distributors SKUs codes to my companies name and information associated to them).

While our companies BI's area report was malfunctioning due to wrong integrated information, numbers where not matching. That's why i developed this dashboard to analyze proper information all together and also because i got on charge of developing new visualizations that helped and encorauged me and our team, to manage relationships with customers with more accurate and efficient information.

#### Data Science in Digital House

This dataset is public from Argentina's goverment, regarding it's publiv bikes. The objective of this notebook is to see the movement of the bikes call "Ecobicis",  this way we could acknowledge which where the bike stations that have bigger demands and so we can try for looking a better way to respond for the bike stocks. It shows a model that was created to predict the flow of bikes.

#### Business Intelligence Analyst - Pernod Ricard

As a BI Analyst i was on charge of helping users to use information and encourage them to use our developed BI dashboards, for them to based their decisions on data and for them to create and take insights from data. That's why i developed a presentation for them to induce them

https://github.com/jmilla01/Joaquin-Millan---Portfolio/blob/main/Induccion_Power_BI.pdf

This dashboard was developed for the BI-EXPORT team, before they didn't had any dashboards, so all their analyses were made in Excel. This dashboard was developed for them so they could manage better their information and using the power of such a good analytical tool such as Power BI. 

This was a project made with a team that involved persons from the relevant areas, the export manager, and IT data engineer, me as a product manager and development of dashboard visualizations. We' ve developed and unite information from diferent sources, made some useful changes to the information that was uploaded on the system, made the connection to Power BI and then created and updated visualizations based on what the export team wanted to see and analyze.

https://github.com/jmilla01/Joaquin-Millan---Portfolio/blob/main/BI_Export_AR.pbix

This dashboard was also created as a new analysis tool for the new team that was divided and created to analyse B2B sales performance. Due to confidentiality and not access to the database i will post a PDF showing some visualizations of the pages developed for them

https://github.com/jmilla01/Joaquin-Millan---Portfolio/blob/main/REPORTE%20B2B.pdf


This dashboard has some changes due to confidential information, it was presented as an idea, to show to my bosses, how to analyze our distributors sells to their customers. This then turned into a project of analysing our distributors information, all in one dashboard, where we performed with a bigger team ETL to adapt our distributors information to our companies same language, and then created a big datawarehouse where we had joined all information to be analyzed. (I don't have this final dashboard due to not working more in the company and confidentiality information) but i will post the idea presented at the beginning.
