# Joaquin Millan Lanhozo --- Portfolio

Outside of work, I am one of 7 siblings, very familiar with 6 nephews as well, and raised in Pilar, a city located north of Buenos Aires, Argentina. I am a person who really enjoys sports and spending time with friends. I am passionate about brain games, knowledge, photography and the beauty of nature.

As a data scientist, I consider myself a person who is passionate about data and the power to discover patterns to uncover insights and drive business decisions. I've been learning and taking lot of courses to become a Data Scientist. 

I have worked in various industries and fields, from different perspectives and with greater or lesser usability of the data, but always analyzing and basing ideas and taking insights with data, making decisions that helped me manage, count and demonstrate results.

I seek to acquire knowledge and add value to an agile and dynamic organization, in which I can develop both professionally and personally.
