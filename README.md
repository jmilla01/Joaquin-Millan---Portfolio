Portfolio

As a data scientist, I consider myself a person who is passionate about data and the power to discover patterns to uncover insights and drive business decisions act based on them. Passionate about the things that can be done with data, from simply describing and showing facts, to building dashboards that demonstrate situations, comparison of scenarios, monitoring of KPI's, models that can predict future events, among others. I am also passionate about being able to tell stories or explain situations with the support of data.

I consider myself a self-taught, analytical person who adapts very well to the situation being dealt with and who always manages to find efficiencies and improvements with data and mainly through its analysis.

I have worked in various industries and fields, from different perspectives and with greater or lesser usability of the data, but always analyzing and based on data, I was able to make decisions that helped me manage, count and demonstrate results.

Outside of work, I am one of 7 siblings, very familiar with 6 nephews as well, and raised in Pilar, in the north of the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. I am a person who really enjoys sports and spending time with friends. I am passionate about brain games, knowledge, photography and the beauty of nature.

I seek to acquire knowledge and add value to an agile and dynamic organization, in which I can develop both professionally and personally.
