# Joaquin-Millan---Portfolio


As a data scientist, I consider myself a person who is passionate about data and the power to discover patterns to uncover insights and drive business decisions act based on them. I have worked in various industries and fields, from different perspectives and with greater or lesser usability of the data, but always analyzing and based on data, I was able to make decisions that helped me manage, count and demonstrate results.

Outside of work, I am one of 7 siblings, very familiar with 6 nephews as well, and raised in Pilar, in the north of the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. I am a person who really enjoys sports and spending time with friends. I am passionate about brain games, knowledge, photography and the beauty of nature.

I seek to acquire knowledge and add value to an agile and dynamic organization, in which I can develop both professionally and personally.
